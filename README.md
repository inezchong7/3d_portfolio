<h1>3D Web Portfolio</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I decided to follow along with this tutorial for two reasons: (1) to learn and familiarise myself with popular web frameworks and increase my skills/ knowledge, and (2) to gain exposure to working with 3D models for enhanced web design. Even though this was a guided process, I still spent my fair share of time troubleshooting and debugging the application to ensure smooth operation. </p>
<p>(*code is on my master branch)</p>
